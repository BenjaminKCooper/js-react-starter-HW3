## What I did:

For this project, I made a React-based note taking application.  It has the following functionality:

- Make a note with a given title
- Delete a note
- Move a note
- Edit a note
- Change the format of the note with MarkDown text

The app was designed in preperation for the next assignment, in which we will be able to add Firebase functionality!

## What worked, what did not work?

I was able to add all the necessary functionality! Yay!

I spent a while trying to update the size of the individual note based on the markdown present.  However I was unable to finish this fucntionality, as I could not get it to work for more than one note.
